    "# What are the challenges asssociated with memory management in python ?\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Key Challenges Associated with Memory Management in Python:\n",
    "1. Reference Cycles (Circular References)\n",
    "Python uses reference counting, but circular references (e.g., object A references B, and B references A) can prevent objects from being freed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Python's garbage collector can detect and collect these, it may not always do so promptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "example:\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.b = None\n",
    "\n",
    "a = A()\n",
    "b = A()\n",
    "a.b = b\n",
    "b.b = a  # circular reference\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Memory Leaks\n",
    "Memory leaks can occur if objects are unintentionally kept alive (e.g., stored in global variables, caches, or long-lived containers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, this can consume more memory than necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fragmentation\n",
    "Python's memory allocator may cause memory fragmentation, where free memory is split into small blocks, making it inefficient to allocate large objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Uncollectable Garbage\n",
    "Some objects (e.g., those with custom __del__ methods involved in reference cycles) may become uncollectable because the garbage collector cannot safely destroy them.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Overhead from High-Level Abstractions\n",
    "Python's high-level features (e.g., dynamic typing, object creation, and garbage collection) can introduce memory overhead compared to lower-level languages like C or C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Large Object Retention\n",
    "Objects like large lists or data structures might not be released promptly if they're still referenced, even if unintentionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Poor Use of Data Structures\n",
    "Using inefficient data structures (e.g., lists instead of sets or dictionaries for lookups) can increase memory usage\n",

    "Since I/O-bound tasks spend lots of time waiting, multithreading can improve performance by overlapping these waits.\n",

    "Threads share the same memory space, reducing the overhead of creating separate processes.\n",
